This is Ekansh's Code:

Step 0: 'head' represents the ListNode and 'val' represents the value of the node that needs to be replaced
Step 1: I checked if the head of the list is to be removed. if yes, then the head is shifted to the next node after the head.
Step 2: Then a new pointer 'current' is introduced that represents the current position and help in traversal.
Step 3: Then nodes are traversed checking if the current node and next node exist in the list(current != null && current.next != null)
Step 4: If present, we have to check whether the next node on the list have the same value as variable 'val' that needs to be removed.
Step 5: If value of (current.next == val), we need to skip that node by redirecting it to next node (current.next = current.next.next) hence removing current.next ultimately
Step 6: If false, direct the current pointer to next code 


EKANSH'S CODE:

class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        // Cases to remove head
        while (head != null && head.val == val) {
            head = head.next;
        }

        ListNode current = head;

        // Removal of nodes and traversal
        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            if (current.next.val == val) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            } else {
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
}
