 -The character can jump one unit high initially and 
  must take (maximum height of hurdle - maximum jump height of character) doses 
  of potion to be able to jump all of the hurdles.

    ```
    if k>=max(height):
        return 0
    elif k<max(height):
        doses=max(height)-k
    return doses

    ```

def hurdleRace(k, height):
    diff = 0
    for i in height:
        if diff < i -:
            diff = i - k
        
    return diff
```
