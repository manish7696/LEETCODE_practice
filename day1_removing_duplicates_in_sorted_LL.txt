The question asks to remove duplicate nodes in a sorted linked list.

I used two pointers named current and previous. In the starting, previous is at first node and current is at second node.
There are three cases to consider here:
1) previous.val is == current.val: 
    if True then shift current right and point prev.next to current
2) previous.val == current and current at the end of the list:
    if True then shift current to its next ( Current will become None) and point previous to next to make it the list's end.
3) previous.val is not equal to current.val:
    if True then shift both previous and current to right by one node

## one case which is automatically handled here is that:
    previous and current are at the end of the list and they are not equal. Here in this code they both get shifted to the right 
      by one node which makes current None so that next iteration of while loop stops.


Took a lot of retries..  good luck!!
