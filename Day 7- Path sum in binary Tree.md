## Manish's approach

- make a function inside given function
- call it recursively two times and find its post traversal order
- store the results of left call and right call in s1 and s1 variable
- here s1 represents the answer from left branch and s2 represents the answer from right branch.
- return s1 or s2, because if any branch returns true then the overall answer is true.
